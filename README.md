Hi there
Welcome and feel free to contribute to this project
The project deals with the development of a file organizer GUI build in Java specifically Java Swing.

Yes I have taken into considerations that most organizers already exist developed by organizations like google and microsoft but this sits at that special spot that it goes to a local level
and allow the non tech savy individuals in that field experience the ease of use of technology.
It also incorporates local locations that will aid the user know where it is.

The objective of the project is to enable users (Legal practitioners) to schedule their files and organize them.
NOTE: The project is still in development and aims to implement the following items:
  a) Notifier - a ways to automatically notify the users in advance of the upcoming events. 
  b) Locator - a way for the user to be directed specifically to where they want to be taken using google maps
 
 Progress:
 So far the GUI can log users, schedule, filter their schedule, delete a schedule
